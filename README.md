# Project Explanation: Implementing Unity Catalog for Data Governance
## Project Overview:
In this project, I developed a robust data pipeline using Azure Data Factory to ensure data integrity and efficient handling of datasets. By integrating ADLS GEN2, Databricks, Key Vault, Azure SQL Database, and GitHub, I automated data retrieval and execution, reducing manual effort. Secure password management with Azure Key Vault enhanced data protection, while complex data transformations in Databricks improved data handling efficiency. Additionally, I boosted data retrieval speed and increased operational efficiency through automated pipeline triggers in Azure Data Factory. The system tracked customer orders, demonstrating scalability and reliability.

#### Key Features of Unity Catalog:
#### 1. Centralized Metadata Layer:
* Enables sharing databases, tables, and views across multiple workspaces
#### 2. Security Model:
* Based on ANSI SQL, allowing administrators to grant permissions using a familiar SQL-like syntax.
#### 3. Built-in Auditing:
* Captures user-level audit logs for actions performed against the metastore, enhancing security by providing detailed access logs.
#### 4. Additional Features:
* Delta Sharing: Securely share data in any format across platforms.
* Data Lineage: Tracks data transformations and actions, enabling back-tracing of data derivation.
* Data Discovery: Open search capability to find data based on keywords.
#### Tools and Strategies:
#### 1. Azure Databricks:
* Use Azure Databricks for creating workspaces, managing clusters, and performing data transformations.
* Implement Databricks Access Connectors for secure access to storage accounts.
#### 2. Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2:
* Store metadata and actual data for managed tables.
* Enable hierarchical namespace for efficient data organization.
#### 3. SCIM Provisioning Connector:
* Sync user details from Azure Active Directory to Databricks Unity Catalog for automatic user provisioning.
* Ensure seamless role assignments and user management across systems.
#### 4. Azure Key Vault:
* Securely store and manage sensitive information such as passwords, keys, and secrets.
* Integrate with Databricks and Azure Data Factory to enhance security.
#### 5. Azure Data Factory:
* Create and manage data pipelines for data ingestion, transformation, and movement.
* Use Azure Data Factory to orchestrate the ETL process and automate data workflows.
#### 6. Azure SQL Database:
* Store processed data for analytical purposes.
* Ensure seamless integration with Databricks and other data services.
#### 7. GitHub:
* Use as a storage repository for raw data files.
* Implement data movement from GitHub to ADLS Gen2 for further processing and storage.
#### 8. Azure Triggers:
* Automate workflows and processes based on predefined conditions.
* Use Azure triggers in Data Factory for event-driven data processing.
#### Implementation Steps:
#### 1. Configure Storage for Metastore:
* Create an ADLS Gen2 Storage Account for holding metadata.
#### 2. Create Metastore through Databricks UI:
* Link multiple workspaces to the metastore.
* Enable hierarchical namespace in the storage account to contain metadata and actual data for managed tables.
#### 3. Create and Configure Metastore:
* Set up a Storage Container within the Storage Account.
* Allow Databricks to access the Storage Account using a Databricks Access Connector.
#### 4. Steps to Create a Metastore through Databricks UI:
* Create Azure Databricks Workspaces.
* Configure metastore settings including region, storage account path, and access connector ID.
#### 5. Data Transformation in Databricks:
* Develop notebooks for data transformation using PySpark, SQL, or Scala.
* Integrate with Delta Lake for optimized storage and efficient data processing.
Create Data Pipeline through Azure Data Factory:
#### 6. Define data ingestion sources and destinations.
* Use Azure Data Factory to schedule and orchestrate ETL processes.
* Incorporate data transformation activities within the pipeline using Databricks notebooks.
#### 7. Use Azure Key Vault for Password Security:
* Store database connection strings, API keys, and other sensitive information in Azure Key Vault.
* Configure Databricks and Data Factory to retrieve secrets securely from Key Vault.
#### 8. Store Processed Data in Azure SQL Database:
* Define tables and schemas in Azure SQL Database for storing processed data.
* Use Databricks to write transformed data to Azure SQL Database.
#### 9. Using GitHub as Data Storage:
* Store raw data files in GitHub repositories.
* Set up processes to move data from GitHub to ADLS Gen2 using Azure Data Factory pipelines.
* Ensure version control and traceability of raw data files.
#### 10. Automate Workflows with Azure Triggers:
* Set up Azure triggers in Data Factory to automate data processing based on events, such as file uploads or scheduled intervals.
### Conclusion:
Implementing Unity Catalog enhances data governance by centralizing metadata management, ensuring secure data access, and providing robust auditing and sharing capabilities. This project will significantly improve data security and streamline access management across the organization. Using additional tools and strategies like Azure Key Vault, Azure Data Factory, GitHub, and Azure Triggers, the project will establish a comprehensive and secure data governance framework. Integrating GitHub for data storage and automating the movement of data to ADLS Gen2 will ensure robust management and version control of raw data files.
